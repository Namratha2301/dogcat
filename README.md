# Whoozat

Are you a wildlife explorer with limited knowledge? Do you hear an animal but don't know what that animal is? Is it a dog? a cat? a tiger??? should you be worried? should you take precaution?? Don't worry we are here with the perfect solution for exactly this problem. Presenting to you **Whoozat** a single click application that tells you which animal you are listening to right now. 

# Scope as of Now

The model has been trained to distinguish dog and cat voices as of now. We are still preparing the data for other animals and planning to get the new model trained as soon as possible.

# About the Model

Only about 277 pieces of data points have been made available to train the model. With the limited amount of data there was trouble training the model as we were not able to acheive the required score on the validation dataset. Despite all these issues here are some of the challenges and information about the model:

- Class Imbalance
